SCRIPT Notice
=============

This directory contain custom script(s) to make it easier to build the version of the
manual with the syntax highlighting enabled. This uses the highlight functionality
available in docbook5 together which in turn uses xslthl-2.x.x

The xslthl-2.x.x must therefore be installed into the Java CLASSPATH. 

Three more cautions:

 * This script has only been tested on OpnSuSE

 * This assumes that the path to the DocBook stylesheets are

      /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheets/nwalsh5/current

   Mutatis mutandis.

 * Saxon 6.5.5 Java xslt processor must be installed (and available in the
   Java CLASSPATH)

 * 'xmllint' must be available since that is used to pre-process the xinclude
   to create a flattened XML version of the manual.


Yes, all this is a PITA. But there is no other way to get easy Syntax highlight in DocBoook
besides rolling a completely homegrown solution which is probably even worse. One option
might be to use dynamic highlitning with Javascipt (i.e. JQuery) for the HTML rendering but 
that will not work for PDF output anyway.
